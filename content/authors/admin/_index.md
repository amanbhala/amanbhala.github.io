    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Aman Bhala, a developer equally at home developing microservices, creating customer‑facing features and the cloud infrastructure that powers them.

I’m currently finishing a 4.0‑GPA Master’s in Computer Science at Arizona State University. I recently worked on engineering traffic‑management and Firewall(WAF) integrations at Snowflake, where my work on Envoy‑centric firewalls improved security.

Earlier, at GE Digital I automated Kubernetes‑based releases and observability pipelines, boosting deployment efficiency by 85 percent and trimming AWS spend by 10 percent. I’ve also optimized chip‑validation tooling at NVIDIA, giving me a deep appreciation for performance at every layer of the stack.

Day‑to‑day I code in Golang, Java, C++, and Python, ship microservices with Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS, and keep a close eye on telemetry via Prometheus + Grafana.
